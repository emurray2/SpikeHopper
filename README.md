# SpikeHopper

Bio:
Welcome to the code of my first iOS app. This app was an idea which one of my friends gave me back in 2014 when we were in 8th grade. It is a game where you try to jump over as many spikes as possible as they come at you randomly on the screen. To make the game more challenging, as your score increases, the floor speed also increases. We managed to release the game just before high school started in September 2015. When this game was in the App Store, it had GameCenter capability (and still possibly does), so you could share your high score with your friends.

Important Notes:
I did not develop this game on my own. One of my friends, Sam Shatsky, did an amazing job creating all of the graphics that you see in the game using Photoshop. He also came to me with the idea of the game and how it would work. My job was to make the game do what it was supposed to do by writing code in Apple's Swift Programming Language. I would look up videos on YouTube on how to do specific things in the game, such as making the spikes move. However, I did figure a couple things out on my own, such as adding a pause menu to the game. Also, the music that you hear in the game was created and added by me. I used my digital Clavinova piano to create a background track and played the main melody over it to create the game's iconic music.

How to navigate app files:
The folder titled “Original App Files” contains all of the original files of the app. This includes the project of the app, which can be opened using Xcode.

The folder titled “View Code” contains all of the code that makes up the app in a readable Google Docs format. The original files had the extension .swift and were written using the Swift Programming Language.
